[17:41, 7/28/2017] Chaitanya: 1. The menu (Gallery, Parks link) looks very raw and basic. Can we have something which is a little more dynamic and attractive?

2. The Mojoland logo and text should be enlarged, it is quite small as of now.

3. The background (white) looks a little blank, especially on the top, on the sides of the logo. We should incorporate some minimalistic and simplistic graphic for background.

4. The fonts need to be changed at various places, like terms and conditions page and menu.   
6. Like on the Disneyland webpage, can we have a full video option?
